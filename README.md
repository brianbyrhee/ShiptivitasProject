# ShiptivitasProject
A small project that I did through Y Combinator in 2019 that helps me practice and showcase my skills in Javascript. The project showcases my frontend and backend skills such as implementing a public API, NodeJS and React, as well as my skills in analyzing product usage and SQL.

## Notes
Note that I did not build this project from scratch, but rather built on existing framework created by YC engineers.
